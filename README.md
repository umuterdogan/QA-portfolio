# QA Automation Portfolio – Umut Erdoğan  

👋 Hi, I’m **Umut Erdoğan**, a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer with hands-on experience in **UI, API, and Database testing**.  
Until August 2025, I worked as a **Junior QA Automation Engineer at OpenlyCRM**, where I built end-to-end automation frameworks with Java, Selenium, Rest Assured, and JDBC.  
My technical foundation comes from **CYDEO’s intensive SDET program**, complemented by professional internships in data analysis (Sanofi) and digital strategy (Collectif IDEM, GE Coaching).  

I combine strong technical expertise with a detail-oriented, strategic approach to testing, ensuring product quality and accelerating release cycles.  
Currently, I am pursuing my **Master’s degree in Paris**, which allows me to take on full-time internships with a convention de stage.
