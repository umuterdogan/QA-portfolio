# QA Automation Portfolio – Umut Erdoğan  

👋 Hi, I’m **Umut Erdoğan**, a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer with hands-on experience in **UI, API, and Database testing**.  
I worked at **OpenlyCRM** as a Junior QA Automation Engineer, where I designed and implemented automated testing solutions to improve product quality and accelerate release cycles.  
I am skilled in **Java, Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, TestNG, Cucumber BDD, Rest Assured, and SQL**, with a strong foundation built through CYDEO’s intensive SDET training program.  
Before transitioning into automation engineering, I gained professional experience in **business insight and data analysis at Sanofi** and in **digital marketing as a freelancer**, which sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills.  
I combine strong technical expertise with a detail-oriented, strategic approach to testing, ensuring product quality and accelerating release cycles.  
In addition, I am currently pursuing my **Master’s degree in Paris**, which allows me to take on full-time internships with a convention de stage.  

This portfolio has been created to showcase my ability to design and implement automation frameworks across different testing layers.  
By separating UI, API, and Database projects, I aimed to demonstrate a full-stack approach to software quality assurance—covering front-end behavior, backend validation, and service-level testing.  
Each project reflects real-world practices with CI/CD integration, BDD workflows, and detailed reporting, highlighting not only technical skills but also structured thinking in test design.
